# Project Lambiek

### Welcome to the Lambiek Project! 

Our mission was to create a new and improved version of the Comiclopedia from Lambiek, focusing on modernisation and innovative features. We embarked on a journey to revitalise the platform by implementing a redesigned website and an optimised the search functionality. With over 10,000 articles to browse through, we aimed to provide users with a seamless and engaging experience. By harnessing the latest advancements in web development, we strived to enrich and enhance the exploration of the fascinating world of comics.

## Project overview:

Project Lambiek is a web-based application that leverages modern technologies to enhance the user experience of the existing Comiclopedia platform from Lambiek. The project utilises a tech stack consisting of PHP, Apache (HTTP server), MariaDB (or similar SQL server), NodeJS, npm, Tailwind CSS, and tw-elements.

Key Dependencies:

- PHP 8 or greater: The project is built using PHP, a server-side scripting language known for its versatility and performance.

- Apache HTTP server: Apache is used as the web server to handle HTTP requests and serve the application to users.

- MariaDB or similar MySQL server: The project relies on a database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently. MariaDB or a similar MySQL server is used for this purpose.

- NodeJS and npm: NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime that enables running JavaScript on the server-side. npm (Node Package Manager) is used for managing project dependencies and package installations.

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers a flexible and customizable approach to styling web applications. It is utilized to create a modern and visually appealing user interface.

- tw-elements: tw-elements is a library that provides pre-built UI components compatible with Tailwind CSS. It allows for faster development and consistent styling of the application's UI components.

The project integrates these technologies to create a revamped version of Comiclopedia. The PHP backend handles data retrieval and processing, while Apache serves the application to users. The MariaDB or MySQL server stores the necessary data for the application. NodeJS and npm manage project dependencies and allow for efficient package installations. Tailwind CSS and tw-elements ensure a modern and visually appealing user interface.

The utilisation of these technologies, the project aimed to provide an improved and immersive experience for users exploring the vast world of comics on the Comiclopedia platform.

1. **Check SQL User Privileges and PDO Connection:**
   Ensure that you have the required SQL user privileges and that the PDO connection to your database is properly configured.

2. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You can download and install the latest stable versions from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

3. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   From the root directory of the project, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies: ``` npm install ```

4. **Compile CSS:**
To compile the CSS files, you have two options:
- Run the `npm run tails` script, which will compile the CSS using the configured Tailwind CSS setup.
- Manually compile the CSS if you prefer a custom compilation process.

5. **Host the Project:**
Host the project from your server's document root or a suitable hosting environment. Ensure that your server is properly configured to serve PHP files.

6. **Access the Project:**
Navigate to the hosted project in your web browser. You should be able to access the Lambiek Project and start testing its features.

**Important:**
